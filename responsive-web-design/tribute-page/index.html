          <h2>Rizal And His Intellect</h2>
          <p>
              Born in <time datetime="19-06-1861">June 19, 1861</time>, Rizal was brought up in a wealthy family in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines. Born as a <i>mestizo</i>, from an early age he showed a precocious intellect and during his elementary days, Rizal won poetry contests and impressed his teachers by his ability to pick up foreign languages. Top of his class, he was declared <i>sobresaliente</i>, or outstanding after he graduated after getting a land surveyor and assessor's degree. He also finished Philosophy as pre-law until his mother's failing eyesight caused him to switch for medicine in opthamology. After graduating with <i>sobresaliente</i> marks, Rizal travelled to Madrid to further study medicine and from his experiences travelling in Europe, had further cemented his ideas of reform within his homeland which was then a colony of Spain. 
          </p>
          <h2>A Charming And Handsome Man</h2>
          <p>Jose Rizal, being a polymath, had befriended many friends in academia while studying in Europe. Rizal studied under the patronage of individuals such as Rudolf Virchow and Otto Becker, and dabbled in many things such as architecture, cartography, economics, ethnology, anthropology, martial arts and fencing. Somewhat of a playboy, Jose Rizal had affairs with many women during his time in Europe; in Prague, he had an affair with an unknown woman, and in Brussels he engaged in a romance with one of his landlord's nieces, Suzzana Thil. As his stay in Brussels was short, Suzanna eventually wrote him a letter in French:
              <blockquote>
                After your departure, I did not take the chocolate. The box is still intact as on the day of your parting. Don’t delay too long writing us because I wear out the soles of my shoes for running to the mailbox to see if there is a letter from you. There will never be any home in which you are so loved as in that in Brussels, so, you little bad boy, hurry up and come back…
              </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
              Jose Rizal also had a lover back in the Philippines. Leonor Riviera, Jose Rizal's childhood sweetheart and first love, helped Rizal remained focused while he was studying in Europe. Rizal ultimately married Josephine Bracken, an Irish woman whom he met while he was living in Hong Kong.
          </p>
          <h2>Writings and Works</h2>
          <p>Rizal was the leader of the reform movement of filipinos in Spain and while in Barcelona, he contributed greatly to the newspaper La Solaridad as <q><i>Dimasalang</i></q>, <q><i>Laong Laan</i></q> and <q><i>May Pagasa</i></q>. He wrote on liberal and progressive ideas: the rights for the Filipino people. His agendas included the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>The Philippines be a Province of Spain</li>
                    <li>Representation in the Spanish Cortes</li>
                    <li>Filipino Priests instead of Spanish Friars</li>
                    <li>Freedom of assembly and speech</li>
                    <li>Equal rights before the law</li>
                </ul>
            These ideas were not supported by the Philippine colonial government, and while in Germany Jose Rizal published 2 novels that would brand him a filibustero: Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo were 2 novels written by Rizal that angered the government and educated Filipinos because of its symbolism. Because of these writings and Rizal's later involvement with the Propaganda movement in the Philippines, he was deemed an enemy of the state by the Spanish authorities bc of the noriorety and outcry of his novels.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a rebellion that was implicated to Jose Rizal, he was exiled in Dapitan, Zamboanga Del Norte. His best friend, Ferdinand Blumentritt, kept him in touch with his European friends who sent him correspondance in different languages. A few years more after a full blown revolution started, Rizal was tried and found guilty of rebellion.

        <h2>Trial and Execution</h2>
        <p>
            The <i>Katipunan</i> uprising in <time datetime="19-08-1896">August, 1896</time>, Jose Rizal, then onboard to Cuba to treat yellow fever victims, was arrested on route via spain and was imprisoned in Barcelona before being sent back to Manila for trial. He was implicated with the revolution through his association with <i>Katipunan</i> members. While imprisoned in Fort Santiago he wrote a manifesto desavowing the revolution and declared that education of Filipinos and a development of national identity were prerequisites to freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jose Rizal was court-martialed for rebellion, sedition and conspiracy and was sentenced to death on <time datetime="30-12-1896">December 30, 1896</time> by firing squad. He also wrote a poem, <i>Mi Ultimo Adios</i>, which was hidden in his lamp that was discovered by his family.
